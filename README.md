# Space Invaders (C++ and Allegro5)

by: Jos√© Luis Aguilera Luzania

This is a very simple Space Invaders clone, done in 3 days with C++ and Allegro5. The game is made as a simple practice in my free time.

The game contains a basic main screen, basic gameplay, and a basic GameOver screen, saves the highest recorded score and displays it during gameplay.

The game contains sounds, animations and score saves.

For the creation of the game, the following page was used as a reference for graphics, gameplay, sounds and information in general:
- [Play Guide for Space Invaders, the 1978 Taito Hit Arcade Game (classicgaming.cc)](http://www.classicgaming.cc/classics/space-invaders/play-guide)
