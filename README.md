# Space Invaders (C++ and Allegro5)

by: Jos√© Luis Aguilera Luzania

This is a very simple Space Invaders clone, done in 3 days with C++ and Allegro5. The game is made as a simple practice.

The game contains a basic main screen, basic gameplay, and a basic GameOver screen, saves the highest recorded score and displays it during gameplay.
